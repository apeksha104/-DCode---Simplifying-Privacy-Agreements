        "is still in the form of some document, but with a few sentences based on the length we\n",
        "might want the summary to be. This is similar to an abstract or an executive summary\n",
        "in a research paper. The main objective of automated document summarization is\n",
        "to perform this summarization without involving human input, except for running\n",
        "computer programs. Mathematical and statistical models help in building and\n",
        "automating the task of summarizing documents by observing their content and context.\n",
        "\n",

        "techniques. They are described as follows:\n",
        "- __Extraction-based techniques:__ These methods use mathematical\n",

        "content from the original document such that this subset of content\n",
        "contains the core information and acts as the focal point of the entire\n",

        "The end result from this approach is a short executive summary of a\n",
        "couple of lines extracted from the original document. No new content\n",
        "is generated in this technique, hence the name extraction-based.\n",
        "- __Abstraction-based techniques:__ These methods are more complex\n",
        "and sophisticated. They leverage language semantics to create\n",
        "representations and use natural language generation (NLG)\n",
        "techniques where the machine uses knowledge bases and semantic\n",
        "representations to generate text on its own and create summaries\n",

We will also share your personal information with companies that help us to run our business by processing personal information on behalf of Adobe for the purposes identified above. Such companies include providers of customer support services, payment processing services, fraud monitoring and prevention, email, social media and other marketing platforms and service providers and hosting services. We require these companies to protect your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may share or publish aggregate information that doesnt specifically identify you, such as statistical information about visitors to our websites. There are several places within Adobes websites and apps that allow you to post comments, upload pictures or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you can limit who can see what you share, but there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other users of the app or website. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldnt want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within an app or website that allows you to control who sees what you post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and app, your email address or name andor profile photo may be included and displayed with your message. To remove content you have shared on our websites and apps, please use the same app or website feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. We work hard to protect your personal information. We employ administrative, technical and physical security controls where appropriate, such as encryption, step verification and strict contractual confidentiality obligations for employees and contractors. Your personal information and files are stored on Adobes servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. The main locations where we process your personal information are the US and India, but we also transfer personal information to all other countries in the world where our apps and other products or services are available. We carry out these transfers in compliance with applicable laws for example, by putting data transfer agreements in place to help protect your personal information. If you reside outside of North America, your relationship is with Adobe Ireland. Where Adobe Ireland transfers your personal information to a country which is not within the EEA and is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we rely on one or more of the following legal mechanisms European Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses andor your consent in certain circumstances. A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review upon request, using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. The information above applies to Adobe users who are consumers. Under the law of some jurisdictions, you may have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal information, to correct, delete or restrict processing of your personal information, and to obtain the personal information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format and to ask us to share this information to another controller. In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal information in some circumstances. These rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or which we need to defend claims against us. In addition, most web browsers have a Do Not Track feature that lets you tell websites you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Currently, there is not an accepted standard on how companies should respond to web browsers Do Not Track signals. Accordingly, our apps and websites do not currently recognise or respond to Do Not Track browser signals. To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us or our data protection officer using the details set out below. Additionally, many of our websites and apps allow you to edit your personal information by accessing the my profile, or a similar feature of the app or website you are using. Likewise, you can delete files or photos you have stored in our websites and apps by logging in and using the deletion functions that are available. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to report them to your local privacy regulator or data protection authority and, where applicable, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with Adobe Irelands lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission. To register with Adobe, to create an Adobe ID and to use some Adobe websites, apps, products or services, the provision of some information is mandatory if relevant information is not provided, then we will not be able to administer an Adobe account to you or provide you with the websites, apps, products or services requested. All other provision of your information is optional. Providing optional information will help us to offer you a better experience, such as more personalised or tailored content or offerings. Where we rely on your consent, you will always be able to withdraw that consent, although we may have other legal grounds for processing your information for other purposes, such as those set out above. In some cases, we are able to send you direct marketing without your consent, where we rely on our legitimate interests. Adobe Experience Cloud solutions help our business customers personalise and improve the performance of their websites, apps and marketing messages. For example, these customers may use Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to collect and analyse information about how individuals use their websites. The information collected is stored in our services on behalf of and for use by these business customers. When you register for an account and create an Adobe ID, we process and keep most personal information we have about you for as long as you are an active user of our products, services or apps. When you close your account, we begin deleting certain personal information that we no longer have a business reason to retain, such as your hashed password and your tokenised payment account data. However, we typically retain personal information related to our contract and business transactions with you for ten years after your last interaction with us. Where we process personal information for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the information until you ask us to stop and for a short period after this. We also keep a permanent record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your information so that we can respect your request in future. Occasionally, we may update this privacy policy to allow Adobe to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. If we do, we will change the last updated date at the top of this policy and the revised policy will be posted to this page so that you are aware of the information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.\n",
