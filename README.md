# -DCode---Simplifying-Privacy-Agreements

The solution described was presented at the InfoCamp held at UC Berkeley, 2021.

#DCode – Simplifying Privacy Agreements 

●	Developed a three-fold pipeline using Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) and Text Summarization using NLP to generate concise and comprehensible policy agreements for the users and amplify public awareness on consumer rights and personal information usage.

●	Proposed the idea of ‘ManChinator’, that would make policy agreements accessible to both the community and the MRC algorithm, to carry out Machine vs Human Evaluation comparison of the whole document based on specific parameters using a Semantic Cosine Comparator.
